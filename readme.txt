Notifies the admin by email as soon as a user has successfully logged in. The mails are customizable, the plugin is completely translatable.

== Description ==

Sometimes it is useful to know if – or when – a user successfully logged in to WordPress. Loginpetze generates a notification mail for this incident. This is a conveniant way to e.g. monitor staging sites for customer logins. No need to regularly take a look at statistics or tracking tools. Mails are customizable with shortcodes. All texts are translatable.

Loginpetze 1.x is **not compatible** with WordPress Multisite.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can a brand new plugin have frequently asked questions? =

It hasn't, but there is no way to rename this section to *Probably Upcoming Questions* ;)

= «Loginpetze» – what kind of name is that? =

It's the german word for «login snitch».

= How does it work? =

In short: you install it, you select a user to receive the notification mails and you're done.

If you like to, you can customize the subject and body of the mails. There are placeholders available that you can insert into your template: *username*, *blogname*, *date* and *time*.

= Is the plugin Multisite compatible? =

**Loginpetze 1.x does not work on Multisite installations**, but we intend to add Multisite support to a future version.

= Why did you develop this plugin? =

Occasionally (especially when setting up websites for clients) we wanted to be notified if – or when – anybody logged in to the staging websites. For this purpose we used to add some lines to our `functions.php` files, which was not very comfortable. For conveniance, we turned our code into this plugin.

It was also a good opportunity to learn and to completely play through the process of plugin creation.

= What happens if I deactivate or delete the plugin via my Dashboard? =

**Deactivating** the plugin will just stop the notification mails. Nothing will happen to your settings (which are stored in the database).

However, if you **delete** the plugin, this will remove your settings from the database. If you then re-install it, the default settings will be applied.

= What happens if I just delete the files via FTP? =

This will also stop the notification mails, but since the uninstall routine is not called, nothing will be removed from your database. If you re-install Loginpetze, your custom settings will still be available.

= What happens if I or any other admin delete a user who is set up to receive the notification mails? =

Loginpetze will warn you about this and you can check your settings. In case this warning is ignored, Loginpetze will automatically switch the recipient to the Standard Blog Admin.

= I need more features. Is there a Pro Version available? =

No :)
